- What is the criteria we use to compare countries ? Carefully select comparison
- Focus on variation on dependent variable or independent variable ? What can we control for  ?
- Do our phd really want to draw inferences at the country level ? 

## Northen countries

North european countries are considered as leaders in climate policy

- Early adopters of carbon tax in the 1990's
- Renewable Energy in Sweden or Denmark

## The interesting case of Austria

However, compared to the other countries, Austria is both considered as a laggard in climate policy and do not have a strong polarisation of its attitudes towards climate change. Consequently, we should definitely included it.

What about Czech Republic regarding climate change ? Interesting east european case ? How does it looks when we look at eurobarometer data ?
