# Green and Jennings, the Politics of Competence

Petrocik two components of issue ownership, one which is more long term and stable and one which is more short term and related to competence. 

Green and Jennings propose to distinguish more clearly the two because the second is more related to public opinon and the reputation/performance of a party to handle an issue. Hence in our theory, it may be more related to climate change and governement parties trying to claim credit and gain reputation for handling climate change. 

Debates in the literature about what issue ownership is : competence or spatail competition/proximity, representation or association : Stubager and SLothus 2013, Walgrave et al 2015, 2016. 

The authors distinguish 3 concepts : 

1. Long term issue ownership :relative stable issue strengths
2. Issue ratings : performance
3. Generalized party competence

Hence what we are insterested in is how government may try to claim credit and develop policy reputation on climate change and not about issue ownership because it is not a long term ownership according to Jennings and Green.
