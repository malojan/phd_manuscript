According to Stimson : *"Public opinion rarely matters, because the public rarely cares enough ot act on its concern or preferences. Change happens only when the thresholf of normal public inattention is crossed.""*

> It is probably impossible to say what single thing is the most important factor in American Politcs, but I beleive that thing is public **opinon movement** (p16)

> Change happens when people care. When people care, it is most unwise to stand against it (p17)

What matters to Stimson, how he thinks about public opinon it is about the aggregate, not about individuals, and how this aggregate move over time. He does that from the late 1980's, why opinion aggregate move over time and how it affects politics. In PUblic Opinion in America 1991, Stimson introduces in a scholarly book the public mood and how to estimate it but it was not accessible to a larger audience, what he aims to to in Tides of Consent. 


# Chapter 3 : Left and RIght Movements in Preference

In this chapter, Stimson lays its issue evolution theory. First, he mentions the evolution of the abortion debate in the US. When abortion was liberalized in 1972, Republicains were mostly in favour of it in contrast to Democrats who followed the catholic churach but also ethnic minorities more conservatives on the issue. This theory was developed with Carmines in their 1989 book on Issue evolution of race and the transfroamtion of americain politics. Greg Adams has applied it to abortion in 1997 and women rights by Wolbrecht. 

> We need a theory of how issue emerge, how they evolve and how multiple facets of conflicts come to be encapsulated in a two-sided struggle between the parties

Similar to agenda-setting theories, they postulate the limits of politics in their capacity to respond to issues. And electoral campaigns are "bottleneck". Politcal parties usually do not talk about new issues because they do not like uncertainty, it may raise votes or loose, they feel pressured for coherence. 

But for Carmines and Stimson, NEW ISSUES are corss-cutting, do not just are about scope of government.

The dynamics begins with a critical moment. 

> After a critical moment the two-sided politics in America become four sided. In each party, there are two groups, those supporting and those opposing the new party position. [...] Such a configuration is unstable. It leaves both candidats and voters misaligned with their parties. Misalignement exerts stresses that produce a dynamics resulting, ultimately, in elimination of the stresses ny olding the two-fold alignment in one. 

For Stimson, this works both for voters and candidates.
